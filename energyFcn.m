function E = energyFcn(theta, r)
arguments (Input)
    theta  % first variable is tilt angle; should be a scalar double
    r  % second variable is aspect ratio; should be a scalar double
end

arguments (Output)
    E % output is the energy output of the solar panel; should be a scalar double
end

% Energy is based on cosine of angle differences and shape efficiency
% A = ?;  % constant area for a solar panel in m^2
% nu = ?;  % efficiency function
% sunIntensity = ?;  % sunlight variation with tilt
% fr = ?;  % calculate efficiency drop for extreme shapes

% finally, calculate E for output using the variables above
% E = ?;
end
